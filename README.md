ANSYS Automated Analysis (3A)
3A automates the participation ratio analysis of qubit design variations.

The main functionalities are:
Generation of design variations from an initial ANSYS parametric design.
Queuing of the variation analysis on a local or LSF environment.

Collection of the potential warning or error of each step.

Generation of .csv files containing the participation ratio.
