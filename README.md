ANSYS Automated Analysis (3A)
3A automates the participation ratio analysis of qubit design variations.

The main functionalities are:

Generation of design variations from an initial ANSYS parametric design. <br />
Queuing of the variation analysis on a local or LSF environment.<br />
Collection of the potential warning or error of each step.<br />
Generation of .csv files containing the participation ratio.
